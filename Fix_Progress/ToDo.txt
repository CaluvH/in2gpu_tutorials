Urgent:

* Rebuild freeglut, replace old dll (Done)
o Used CMake VS2013 compiler to generate 32 build;
o Build freeglut.sln with VS 2015 Enterprise Debug 32;
o Added freeglut.dll to Debug folder, freeglutd.lib and freeglut_staticd.lib to Dependencies;
o Include folder remained unchanged;
o Current freeglut version: 3.0.0; (up-to-date)

2) Rebuild glew, replace old dll;
3) Make sure the repo has an up-to-date version of dlls & libs for both 32/64 and Debug/Release;
4) chrono "auto" creates ambiguity, rewrite in less ambiguous way (Multitexturing);
5) For some reason DrawCubeTexture tutorial complains about SOIL link even though this tutorial should not rely at all on SOIL. 
6) Fetch latest compatible version of SOIL that is maintained and up-to-date with OpenGL core 4.5;

Other:
1) Add correct pragma includes in order to get rid of BasicEngine build warnings;
2) Make sure all classes and file names in BasicEngine follow same naming standard (i.e. "vertexFormat" should be "vertex_format");
3) Get rid of deprecated old OpenGL functionality such as GL_QUADS, it's embarrassing! 
4) Rewrite shaders so they are up to date with latest standard. (Note for future self: keep the shader code consistent across the project).
