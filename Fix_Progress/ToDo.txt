Urgent:
=============================================================================
* Rebuild freeglut, replace old dll (DONE)
	o Used CMake VS2013 compiler to generate 32 build;
	o Build freeglut.sln with VS 2015 Enterprise Debug 32;
	o Added freeglut.dll to Debug folder, freeglutd.lib and freeglut_staticd.lib to Dependencies;
	o Include folder remained unchanged;
	o Current freeglut version: 3.0.0; (up-to-date)

* Rebuild glew, replace old dll (DONE)
	o Modified BasicEngine Init current context core to true. Reason for this being I want everything we have to run in core 4.5 if possible.
	o Current GLEW32 version: 1.13.0; (up-to-date)


* Make sure the repo has an up-to-date version of dlls & libs for both 32/64 and Debug/Release (DONE)
	o Added GLEW and FreeGLUT x64 files, and Release files.

* chrono "auto" creates ambiguity, rewrite in less ambiguous way (Multitexturing) (DONE)
	o converted chrono system clock to chrono steady clock throughout the project.

* DrawCubeTexture tutorial SOIL link error even though this tutorial should not rely at all on SOIL (DONE)
 	o Removed unnecessary calls to SOIL.

* Fetch latest compatible version of SOIL (if any) or REPLACE IT WITH Nothings/STB (CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS)
	o Make all tutorials work with SOIL(old and not fully compatible with 4.5 core)	(Done)
	o Used STB from https://github.com/nothings/stb instead of SOIL 	        (In progress)


7) (New)1_DrawCube winding is wrong. The outputted cube has triangle faces not being drawn. 


Other:
=============================================================================
1) Add correct pragma includes in order to get rid of BasicEngine build warnings;
2) Make sure all classes and file names in BasicEngine follow same naming standard (i.e. "vertexFormat" should be "vertex_format");

* Get rid of deprecated old OpenGL functionality such as GL_QUADS, it's embarrassing! (DONE)
	o Multitexturing tutorial now uses GL_TRIANGLES instead of GL_QUADS

4) Rewrite shaders so they are up to date with latest standard. (Note for future self: keep the shader code consistent across the project).
5) Use pre-processor definition for GLEW_STATIC, etc. instead of specifying linker input per test project.
